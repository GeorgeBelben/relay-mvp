// using FocusableLink so it can share CarouselGameTile's sizing (see carousel.tsx).
//
// Deliberately does *not* grow on focus the way CarouselGameTile does -- it's always the last
// slide, and Embla's scroll-range math is computed once assuming every slide stays at its resting
// width (watchResize: false, see carousel.tsx). That's a fine approximation for a game tile
// growing somewhere in the middle of the row, but for the last slide specifically, growing wider
// pushes its true right edge past where Embla thinks the maximum scroll position is -- the
// carousel can't scroll far enough to reveal it, so it's always a little cut off. A ring/color
// change is a perfectly good focus indicator for an action button anyway.
