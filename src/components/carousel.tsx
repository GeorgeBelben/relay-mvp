// selected one grows, and there's always a sliver of the next tile peeking at the edge to hint
// there's more. Only one carousel exists today (Home's recents row), so these live here rather
// than being threaded through as props -- becomes one if a second carousel needs a different size.

// Like Grid, but a real Embla carousel -- snap-to-slide motion, instead of an abrupt edge-to-edge
// native scroll. Embla has no idea when virtual focus moves (gamepad/keyboard navigation never
// touches real DOM focus -- see lib/focus), so each slide is cloned here with an `onTileFocus`
// that reports its index back up.
//
// The focused tile grows via a *real* width change (CarouselGameTile swaps CAROUSEL_TILE_WIDTH
// for CAROUSEL_TILE_WIDTH_FOCUSED), the same mechanism the grid tiles already use for their own
// h-48/h-64 grow-on-focus, just on the other axis. That was a deliberate do-over of an earlier
// transform-based version (scale() on an absolutely-positioned inner box) that turned into a
// losing battle against overflow clipping somewhere in the ancestor chain, and which overlapped
// the next tile rather than genuinely moving it. Real width growth pushes later slides along via
// normal flex reflow instead -- no overlap, no clipping, and "grows from the left" falls out for
// free since a wider box's left edge doesn't move.
//
// One deliberate approximation: Embla is left believing every slide is always at its resting
// width (watchResize: false below), even though the focused one is actually wider. Embla's
// default behavior is to auto-correct for a slide resizing via its own ResizeObserver -- but
// that correction is an instant, unanimated reInit(), which was fighting the width's smooth CSS
// transition (a hard snap mid-grow) and is exactly what read as "jarring". Since only one slide
// is ever wider at a time, the positional error this approximation introduces is small and
// doesn't compound -- a good trade for a scroll that's actually allowed to animate.

  // range and the last slide falls short of the viewport, always partly hidden.
